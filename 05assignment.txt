Mastering Java Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, and Logical in Action
In this exercise, you will apply your knowledge of Java operators to perform arithmetic calculations, make value comparisons, and evaluate logical conditions.

Your task is to write a Java program that:

      1.  Declare two integer variables a = 20 and b = 10.

      2.  Perform the following operations:

           a. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide a and b

           b. Compare if a is greater than b and store the result in a boolean variable

           c. Check if a > b and b > 0 using a logical operator and store the result

      3.  Print the results of all operations using System.out.println() in the specified format.

Instructions:

Do not change the class name or method signature; both are already provided.

Focus on writing correct operations and printing each result.

Use System.out.println() for each output.

Ensure that spacing, punctuation, and concatenation in your print statements exactly match the expected output.

Expected Output:

  Addition:  30

  Subtraction:  10

  Multiplication:  200

  Division:  2

  Is a greater than b?  true

  Is a > b and b > 0?  true
